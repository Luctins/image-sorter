* Minimal Image sorter

This is a idea that i've been meaning to make for a while, right now it's super beta and probably will change a lot at random intervals.

** Features
- autossugestion with persistent editable categories (press tab to accept)
- forward/backwards seeking with bar
- Progress bar for the current session
- More or less cross platform (except for the open file button)

** Screenshots

:END:
*** Autocompletion
- [ ] Move the cursor to the end when accepting suggestions (Not sure how to move the text cursor yet)
- [ ] Cycle suggestions by pressing TAB
*** Integration
- [ ] Rely on the type system
- [ ] Properly modelled interactions between modules
*** Do and commit system
That allows queuing actions and undoing recent actions.
- [ ] Action
*** Usability
- [ ] Prompt for a path to use when no images are on the current directory and no command line arguments are provided
- [ ] More keyboard shortcuts and a shortcut detection rework (allow for mouse free operation)
- [ ] implement =UiState= system with different screens based on state
- [ ] Implement scrolling for very tall images
*** Misc
