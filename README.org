* Minimal Image sorter

This is a idea that i've been meaning to make for a while, right now it's super beta and probably will change a lot at random intervals.

** Features
- autossugestion with persistent editable categories (press tab to accept)
- forward/backwards seeking with bar
- Progress bar for the current session
- More or less cross platform (except for the open file button)
- Editable layout using config files

** Screenshots

** TO-DO
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2023-01-10 Tue 21:31]
:END:

*** Autocompletion
- Move the cursor to the end when accepting suggestions (Not sure how to move the text cursor yet)
- Cycle suggestions by pressing TAB
-
*** Do and commit system
- That allows queuing actions and undoing recent actions.
-
*** Usability
- Add keyboard shortcuts based on the layout configuration
  - e.g `C- [key id]` to move to that category.
- Implement =UiState= system with different screens based on state
- Implement scrolling for very tall/wide images
-
*** Misc
- Reddit banner remover ?

*** Debug
- [ ] Add a debug window for general use
