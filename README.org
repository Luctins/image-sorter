* Minimal Image sorter

This is a idea that i've been meaning to make for a while, right now it's super beta and probably will change a lot at random intervals.

** Features
- autossugestion with persistent editable categories (press tab to accept)
- forward/backwards seeking with bar
- Progress bar for the current session
- More or less cross platform (except for the open file button)

- [ ] Autocompletion
  - [ ] Move the cursor to the end when accepting suggestions (Not sure how to move the text cursor yet)
  - [ ] Cycle suggestions by pressing TAB
- [ ] Make code more 'holistic'
  - [ ] Rely on the type system
  - [ ] Properly modelled interactions between modules
- [ ] Add a debug window for general use
- [ ] Prompt for a path to use when no images are on the current directory and no command line arguments are provided
  - [ ] implement =UiState= system with different screens based on state
- [ ] Implement scrolling for very tall images
- [X] Get the current directory instead of reading from a file or read it from the command line
