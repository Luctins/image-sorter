* Minimal Image sorter

This is a idea that i've been meaning to make for a while, right now it's super beta and probably will change a lot at random intervals.

** Features
- autossugestion with persistent editable categories (press tab to accept)
- fw/bw seek with bar
- progress bar

** Screenshots

:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2023-01-10 Tue 21:31]
:END:
- [ ] Autocompletion related
  - [ ] Move the cursor to the end when accepting suggestions (Not sure how to move the text cursor yet)
  - [ ] Cycle suggestions by pressing TAB
  - [ ] Offer a dropdown like explained [[https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/122][here]]
- [ ] Make code more 'holistic'
  - [ ] Rely on the type system
  - [ ] Properly modelled interactions between modules
- [ ] Get the current directory instead of reading from a file or read it from command line
- [ ] Add a debug window for general use
